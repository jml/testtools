{"body":"testtools is a set of extensions to the Python standard library's unit testing framework.\r\n\r\nThese extensions have been derived from years of experience with unit testing in Python and come from many different sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nIf you would like to learn more about testtools, consult our documentation in the 'doc/' directory.  You might like to start at 'doc/overview.rst' or 'doc/for-test-authors.rst'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\nThis project is distributed under the MIT license and copyright is owned by Jonathan M. Lange and the testtools authors. See LICENSE for details.\r\n\r\nSome code in 'testtools/run.py' is taken from Python's unittest module, and is copyright Steve Purcell and the Python Software Foundation, it is distributed under the same license as Python, see LICENSE for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Required Dependencies\r\n\r\n * Python 2.6+ or 3.0+\r\n\r\nIf you would like to use testtools for earlier Python's, please use testtools 0.9.15.\r\n\r\n * extras (helpers that we intend to push into Python itself in the near future).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Optional Dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you would like to use our undocumented, unsupported Twisted support, then you will need Twisted.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use ``fixtures`` then you can either install [fixtures](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/fixtures) or alternatively just make sure your fixture objects obey the same protocol.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug reports and patches\r\n\r\nPlease [report bugs using Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/testtools). Patches should be submitted as Github pull requests, or mailed to the authors. See ``doc/hacking.rst`` for more details.\r\n\r\nThere's no mailing list for this project yet, however the testing-in-python mailing list may be a useful resource:\r\n\r\n * Address: testing-in-python@lists.idyll.org\r\n * Subscription link: http://lists.idyll.org/listinfo/testing-in-python\r\n\r\n\r\n### History\r\n\r\ntesttools used to be called 'pyunit3k'.  The name was changed to avoid conflating the library with the Python 3.0 release (commonly referred to as 'py3k').\r\n\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\n\r\n * Canonical Ltd\r\n * Bazaar\r\n * Twisted Matrix Labs\r\n * Robert Collins\r\n * Andrew Bennetts\r\n * Benjamin Peterson\r\n * Jamu Kakar\r\n * James Westby\r\n * Martin [gz]\r\n * Michael Hudson-Doyle\r\n * Aaron Bentley\r\n * Christian Kampka\r\n * Gavin Panella\r\n * Martin Pool\r\n * Monty Taylor","note":"Don't delete this file!
